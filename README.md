# C-PROGRAMMING-FUNDAMENTALS
Basic algorithm implementations and mathematical tools developed for Computer Engineering coursework using C.
# C Programming Fundamentals 🚀

This repository contains fundamental algorithm implementations and mathematical tools developed during my Computer Engineering studies at Marmara University. It demonstrates my grasp of core programming concepts like arrays, loops, and memory management.

## 📂 Project Contents

### 1. Basic Arithmetic Calculator
- Performs addition, multiplication, and division operations.
- **Key Concept:** Demonstrates standard Input/Output operations using `printf` and `scanf` functions.

### 2. Body Mass Index (BMI) Analyzer
- Calculates the Body Mass Index based on user height and weight data.
- **Key Concept:** Mathematical formula implementation and data processing.

### 3. Exam Success Evaluator
- Determines whether a student passes or fails a course based on Midterm and Final grades.
- **Key Concept:** Conditional logic (`if-else` blocks) to determine status based on weighted averages.

### 4. Number Guessing Game 🎮
- An interactive game where the user tries to guess a random number (between 1-100) generated by the computer.
- **Key Concept:** Usage of Random Number Generation (`rand()`) and loop structures (`while` / `do-while`).

### 5. Array Summation Algorithm
- Takes two separate arrays (5 elements each) from the user and calculates their sum.
- **Key Concept:** Working with Data Structures (**Arrays**) and iterating through data using `for` loops.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** C
- **IDE:** VS Code
- **Concepts:** Algorithms, Data Structures (Arrays), Control Flow, I/O Operations, Randomization.
